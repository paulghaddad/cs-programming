;;; Problem 4

;;; For each of the following expressions, what must f be in order for the evaluation of the expression to succeed, without causing an error? For each expression, give a definition of f such that evaluating the expression will not cause an error, and say what the expressionâ€™s value will be, given your definition.

;;; f
;;; f must be a type such as a number or procedure that is not evaluated.

(define f 2)

(define f (lambda (x) 1))

;;; f must be a procedure with no arguments

;;; so this will error
