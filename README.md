# Computer Science: Programming

My work for the [teachyourselfcs](https://teachyourselfcs.com) Programming Module.

## Week 1: Functional Programming

This week consists of section 1.1, with the following topics:

* Basic syntax of Scheme
* Functions and their constructs: formal parameters, actual argument expression, actual argument value
* Evaluating combinations and using compound procedures
* The substitution model for procedure application
* Normal vs. Applicative Order
* Conditional expressions and predicates
* Procedures as black box abstractions, including the idea of recursion

## Week 2: Higher-Order Procedures

This week consists of section 1.3, with the following topics:

* Functions as data, or objects, as opposed to the more familiar view of functions as processes
* Using functions as arguments, allowing us to generalize procedures. These higher-order procedures can take in a number or function that specifies what varies in using the pattern, such as calculating the area of various shapes or summing a series.
